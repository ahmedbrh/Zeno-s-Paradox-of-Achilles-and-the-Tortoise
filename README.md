# Zeno's Paradox Visualizer

An interactive educational web application that visualizes **Zeno's Paradox of Achilles and the Tortoise** using React and modern web technologies.

=> 
Zeno's paradox argues that motion is impossible because:
- Before Achilles can reach the tortoise, he must first get halfway there
- By the time he reaches that point, the tortoise has moved forward
- This process repeats infinitely, suggesting Achilles can never catch up

The resolution involves understanding that infinite sums can converge to finite values, as demonstrated by calculus.

## Features

- Watch Achilles chase the tortoise in continuous motion
-  Explore Zeno's paradoxical reasoning one step at a time
- : Adjust speeds and head start distance with sliders
